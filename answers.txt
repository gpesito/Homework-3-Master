Hello Gabby! This is a message

Task 1: 
git fetch downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but doesnâ€™t merge them into your local branch. It updates your view of remote branches. You need to manually merge or checkout to see the changes in your working directory.

Task 2:
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in code. Github is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing collaboration and sharing of code online.
